### Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ryan Cogswell, a software engineer and singer in the Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN area.

I've been a software engineer since 1996. Since 2000 I've worked on a web application that was originally built entirely in ColdFusion using SQL Server. It is now primarily a Java application on the back end using PostgreSQL and all of the new front-end work is being done in React leveraging MUI.

On the side, I'm a tenor section leader in the [MN Chorale](https://www.mnchorale.org/) which I have been in since 1996.

I make occasional GitHub contributions to MUI, but my biggest impact to the MUI community has been via [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/material-ui/topusers).
